       Hello, my name is Tina Octaviani, and I am from Indonesia. 
       Continuing to the level 2 in the <em> Interactive Media Design</em> program.  
       I am still nervous about the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and
       <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> class.
   </p>

   <p>
       The course name is <strong> mtm6201</strong> 
       and this is part of participation 1. My Github username is octa0004.
   </p>

   <p>
       One exciting thing I did over break time was joining <abbr title="Persatuan Mahasiswa Indonesia di Kanada">PERMIKA Ottawa</abbr> 
       to be part of their design team.
